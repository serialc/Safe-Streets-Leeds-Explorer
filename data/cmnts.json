The government has recently provided revised guidance to local authorities that expects them to make road space available for active travel and also a funding stream to enable this to happen in a matter of weeks. Leeds Beckett University and the University of Leeds are both working hard to improve active travel rates amongst their staff. We run two open access bike workshops, hire over 500 bikes to staff and students, provide secure bike parking, showers and travel advice as well limiting on-site parking to staff who live close to our campuses. As joint institutions we have over 50,000 staff and students many of whom will use this corridor daily as both institutions have facilities in Headingley and the city. Our biggest barrier to further improving our already relatively high active travel rates remains the current level of cycling and walking infrastructure on the A660 corridor. When we ask our staff what the biggest barrier is to them making active travel choices for their commutes, the most common responses are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot feeling safe cycling\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo many cars\u00e2\u0080\u009d they state that these are the reasons why they choose to drive, when often they live close enough to make active travel choices. I know the council is as keen as we are to promote active travel. Temporary infrastructure, such as the Orca wands used on the A65 would greatly increase the experience of cyclists on the A660. Providing segregation from traffic and the minimum 2m social distance which cannot be met with the existing marked cycle lanes or pavement width. This measure or ones similar would provide an environment where our staff and students as well as many other members of the public can make safer active travel decisions in even more numbers at this time. I hope you feel able to help with making this provision possible or perhaps suggesting how else the council might be able to help bring about much needed improvements on this often congested arterial route?","abdate":"2020-05-15"},"178":{"cid":"5ebebab2874f930010eb1301","title":"Footpath","feeling":3,"consent":"NA","theme":"Schools - creating space for walking/cycling","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":3,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ebebab2874f930010eb1301","lat":53.8147406411235,"long":-1.44066274166107,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Need a route here_,_Potential for more walking here_,_want access","solutions":"Wider pavements_,_Maintenance_,_give more people access to gates and cut back bushes","comment":"change all council alley gates to an smartphone app or physical card so every Leeds resident has access to traffic free paths (ps if crime happens insted of climbing over the gates you have their ID)","abdate":"2020-05-15"},"179":{"cid":"5ebebab7874f930010eb1302","title":"Main road","feeling":0,"consent":true,"theme":"Main roads - more pedestrian and cycle space","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":19,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ebebab7874f930010eb1302","lat":53.8065369262206,"long":-1.54836416244507,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Feels unsafe cycling here","solutions":"Less traffic_,_Lower speeds","comment":"Difficult area for cycling as cars in 3 lanes eager to get to the next junction.

For example from here to DoubleTree by Hilton at Granary Wharf the walk is 0.5-0.6 miles according to google maps roughly 10-12 minutes depending on which route you take. This is really poor considering how short the distance is as the crow flys. There is a tunnel on the opposing bank of the River Aire to where this point is plotted on the map. This tunnel links directly through to Granary Wharf (actually would come out at the bricked up arches at between Candle House and The DoubleTree - I remember seeing a map somewhere). If a pedestrian/cycle bridge were installed across the river and the tunnel opened up, with lighting similar to the dark arches this would make the journey distance roughly 0.1 of a mile, so this would be an 80% reduction to the distance that people have to currently travel between these two parts of the city! This would be a reduction from 10/12 minutes to approx 2 mins! This is 100% an avenue that needs to be explored, especially as more apartments are under construction and planned for Holbeck Urban Village and this would link directly to the main business core of the city centre.","abdate":"2020-05-15"},"259":{"cid":"5ebec8910cb6e500107b9eab","title":"Main road","feeling":0,"consent":true,"theme":"Main roads - more pedestrian and cycle space","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":6,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ebec8910cb6e500107b9eab","lat":53.8009486366855,"long":-1.66425168514252,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Feels unsafe walking here_,_Not child friendly here_,_Difficult to cross","solutions":"Better crossings","comment":"NA","abdate":"2020-05-15"},"260":{"cid":"5ebec8af0cb6e500107b9ead","title":"Cycle lane","feeling":100,"consent":false,"theme":"Main roads - more pedestrian and cycle space","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":19,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ebec8af0cb6e500107b9ead","lat":53.8196396613401,"long":-1.57629230594466,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Feels unsafe cycling here","solutions":"Boxed off area to stop queing traffic","comment":"Queuing cars and trucks impede cyclists' visibility to traffic turning right here.

If you are cycling back from the station this is a main cycling route. If you are travelling at times of low traffic, you just have to sit at a red light until a car pulls up behind you and the lights will then immediately change. This isn't too much of an issue when there is more traffic but can cause problems when there isn't. As it is surrounded by bars you can be quite vulnerable. Once, cycling home from the train station at night after a late shift, a group of drunk men started to climb on me and my bike as I had been stuck at the lights so long.

As the pavement is narrow and only one side of the Lane it is not possible to pass keeping 2 meters apart unless you go onto the road. As the traffic is now increasing this is becoming increasingly dangerous. Today I witnessed an elderly resident who walks with a stick having to move into the road to avoid runners and people with children cycling on the pavement only to then be passed in close proximity by two cyclists on the road. At the same time cars were approaching. I would suggest Old Lane is closed to motorised traffic except for emergency vehicles and access only. This would allow both safe walking, running and cycling and would not prevent motorists reaching their destination as there are alternative main roads available. I am deeply concerned that motorists will return to their previous habit of mounting the pavement to pass rather than giveway at narrow sections which at this time could be disasterous. I would also suggest better maintenance of the foot paths further along Old Lane and more generally in the area. Many are narrowed by overgrown weeds and trees which are seldom if ever cut back. Again this makes passing difficult especially now many cyclists are using the footpaths as well. I have also witnessed a number of styles on our local footpaths which seem to be have constructed with the sole intention of discouraging people from using them. This includes landowners nailing planks of wood across with no cross planks and no access for dogs. These should also be inspected and corrective action inforced to ensure people, especially elderly or those with accessibility issues to use more footpaths which in turn may reduce footfall in popular areas. I am sure many local residents would be more than willing to volunteer to support LCC undertake this work. . .   .

There needs to be a speed limit for cyclists and regular monitoring - you can't squeeze past two people walking in different directions and maintain social distancing. Cyclists plus pedestrians need to stop and wait to make sure the distance is kept. Possibly a rail could be erected along the side of the canal so people may walk in the grass closer to the canal but not fear falling in. The bridges are also a pinch point - mirrors could help to see if anyone is coming from the other side. Or even motion sesnsitive traffic lights. Also I have noticed pedestrians tend to walk on the right (as they would on a country road to face oncoming traffic) and cyclists  always cycle on teh left, thsi means when they are going in different directions they can come face to face and passing becomes confused. So signs about speed, cyclists stopping or dismounting for pedestrians, all walk and cycle on the left. Once we get past October this route will be dark for the evening home commute and is pitch black so temporary lighting would help. One last thing - encourage employers to allow a staggered entry/exit time or half day working from home so commuters are not all traveling at the same time. Then monitor the busy times and publish when it is the quietest so people can choose to use it for leisure on these times.

It would be lethal to cycle up that hill on the main road because the cars and lorries are going at 60mph and have no room to move over to pass you and usually have too much traffic behind them to slow down. But there is no path, just mud and long grass, so you can only get from the Rodley Roundabout to the Horsforth Roundabout by foot or cycle on a path. This may be like this to discourage school children to cross the ring road to the high school as there have been fatalities in the past. Therefore as well as a proper path  it would need a barrier to stop people crossing over until they get to the pedestrian bridge. The space is there to make a nice wide path - this could be a permanent feature after we recover from covid, There are green verges in many other sections of the ring road around Leeds that could be made into nice wide and safe pedestrian routes but have been left as just grass.

We have lived here for eight years and in that time, the volume of traffic using this narrow winding road has increased quite dramatically with cars, vans, lorries and even buses often mounting the kerb to allow for two way traffic to pass each other in narrow places. The vehicles often speed  along with a total disregard for pedestrians, cyclists, horses and children who in particular walk along the single pavement to access the village green for leisure. During lockdown this residential street has seen a huge amount of new footfall, increased numbers of walkers, cyclists, runners, families with young children and pushchairs, disabled people in wheelchairs and elderly people,  taking exercise as advised by the government. This has been great to see and the lack of vehicles has meant is has been a safe haven to exercise, enjoy nature,  tranquility and less pollution which in these difficult and distressing times can only be a positive result. The residential street has a pavement on one side only, therefore in order to social distance,  people have  been safe to go onto the road to  pass others courteously and safely. Immediately since lockdown restriction were eased, traffic has quickly returned to almost full capacity which has resulted in pedestrians, runners etc being unable to pass each other whilst social distancing as the  single  footpath is too narrow. . Not only that, it took me a full three minutes to cross the road safely from my driveway yesterday just with the sheer number of cars, then cyclists and myself having to look for a socially distant space on the pavement on the other side of the road.. During this pandemic, at least, I think  narrow residential streets  with one or no safe  footpath should be closed to through traffic and that traffic be rerouted onto the major roads. I work four miles away from my home and would be very happy to cycle there if I felt safe on the roads but I simply don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I would like to see more provisions for cyclists on the streets of Leeds to make it safer and eco friendly way to travel. I would even go as far as accepting a bicycle tax if it meant there were good,  safe cycle lanes to use. I also like the idea of cycle hire, cycle stations where you can hire bikes from. They could be near park and ride stations too. Finally, I am a convert of the Leeds clean air scheme which I enjoyed for one day last year in LS17 at my place of work. I would like to see this promoted more and rather than it be a choice to apply, it become compulsory once a year or more frequently especially in areas of Leeds where there are fewer green spaces, at least the children can play out safely on their streets and connect with their communities and nature.

One way routes via Victoria Road etc ignore the fact that Headingley Lane is a hugely busy bus corridor in normal times. A one-way system would mean that bus stops in the return direction could be up to 500maway from their outbound stop and at the bottom of a hill (on Victoria Road, or Cardigan Road). This would make buses much less attractive in this corridor and almost certainly lead to more not less car use. Also, one way streets tend to become race tracks due to their being no opposing traffic. Witness Alma Road. Realistically the options for Headingley Lane  are limited to making it safer to cycle while introducing city-wide measures such as parking controls to reduce  the amount of car traffic. In the short term using the temporary cycle Lane \u00e2\u0080\u0098wands\u00e2\u0080\u0099 being proposed for the A65 would help make the existing cycle lanes feel a little better delineated.

Now it is not possible to provide for safe social distancing for pedestrians and cyclists while maintaining two lanes of traffic. As widening the carriageway is not possible, I propose reallocating space away from private cars using the A660 as a through route to and from the city centre. This route could then serve as a corridor for safe walking, cycling and as an uncongested blue light route for emergency services use. Though radical, due to space constraints it is not possible to facilitate segregated cycle lanes or widen pavements without taking this measure, as cars are the most space inefficient method of transport that uses this route.  Dealing with the current pandemic whilst also building the basis for better and more environmentally friendly transport in Leeds in the future is very important. Reducing the number of routes in the city for cars may move congestion problems to other parts of the network. However, without doing this it is impossible to create spaces on the road network for active travel to be a safe and attractive option. It is impossible for buses to run to time regardless of congestion elsewhere. During busy times, Leeds residents in trouble will have to continue waiting longer for potentially lifesaving emergency services. Taking space away from cars will make other options better and give those driving a real reason to take the bike or the bus, reducing the number of cars on our road permanently.

It's always a danger crossing as cars do drive illegally and rapidly up Alma Road.  The road is used blatantly as a rat run at both rush hours (one in the wrong direction) to avoid Shaw Lane lights.  Residents have campaigned for years for Alma Road to be blocked with removal bollards like Wood Lane, to no avail.  Also in terms of achieving more safe amenity in this residential area, a small children's playground would be a godsend, maybe on unused land on Wood Lane belonging to Lupton Residences but  untended.

Previously I would just walk my bike across the bridge, but as others have commented, the narrow pavement now makes it impossible to do this safely.","abdate":"2020-05-20"},"2041":{"cid":"5ec3976ef6ba0000142b018b","title":"Other","feeling":47,"consent":true,"theme":"Main roads - more pedestrian and cycle space","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":0,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec3976ef6ba0000142b018b","lat":53.7210661147912,"long":-1.4293384552002,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Need a route here_,_Potential for more cycling here","solutions":"Better crossings","comment":"Bridge & cycle route crossing river near M62 linking national cycle route 67 with Canal tow path ","abdate":"2020-05-20"},"2042":{"cid":"5ec397a65b73820013bb4fe3","title":"Main road","feeling":100,"consent":false,"theme":"NA","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":0,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec397a65b73820013bb4fe3","lat":53.8337262862587,"long":-1.53224945068359,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"No more cycle lanes are needed ","solutions":"Have good access for vehicles","comment":"We already have too many cycle lanes and many not well used.","abdate":"2020-05-20"},"2043":{"cid":"5ec39c535b73820013bb502f","title":"Cycle lane","feeling":3,"consent":true,"theme":"Main roads - more pedestrian and cycle space","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":9,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec39c535b73820013bb502f","lat":53.8068220384724,"long":-1.58410727977753,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Potential for more cycling here","solutions":"Space for cycling_,_Improved signage","comment":"To add to other comment about the bus stop in the middle of the cycle lane: I think the pavement is supposed to become shared space for cyclists and pedestrians at this point (which is what the signage suggests), but in practice this is impossible to do while social distancing, and pedestrians are (understandably) confused about why cyclists are suddenly in 'their space'. Better signage, or a dropped kerb and cycle lane in the road for a short distance, would be safer.

The average speed is more like 40. What we have noticed during lockdown is a sudden flourishing of people on bikes, running, walking. It's been lovely. The cars still drive far too fast, but at least there are many less than usual. What I fear is that once this is over, we'll just return to speeding traffic.

In pedestrianizing Yeadon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shopping district would help to boost the local economy and create a public realm that could become permanent if successful.","abdate":"2020-05-21"},"2214":{"cid":"5ec410e825de750010919bc2","title":"Main road","feeling":2,"consent":false,"theme":"NA","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":3,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec410e825de750010919bc2","lat":53.7654309352897,"long":-1.55941486358643,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Key destination_,_Feels unsafe walking here_,_Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Difficult to cross","solutions":"Reduce speed limit _,_Less traffic_,_Lower speeds_,_Better crossings_,_Trees and planting_,_Places to sit_,_Space for cycling","comment":"NA","abdate":"2020-05-21"},"2215":{"cid":"5ec41120a04ccf0010e38e35","title":"Main road","feeling":3,"consent":false,"theme":"NA","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":3,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec41120a04ccf0010e38e35","lat":53.7578582223055,"long":-1.56201124191284,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Need a route here_,_Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Difficult to cross","solutions":"Better crossings_,_Trees and planting","comment":"NA","abdate":"2020-05-21"},"2216":{"cid":"5ec41164a04ccf0010e38e36","title":"Main road","feeling":1,"consent":false,"theme":"NA","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":7,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec41164a04ccf0010e38e36","lat":53.7748790554679,"long":-1.57773971557617,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Key destination_,_Need a route here_,_Potential for more cycling here_,_Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Difficult to cross","solutions":"Less traffic_,_Lower speeds_,_Wider pavements_,_Better crossings","comment":"NA","abdate":"2020-05-21"},"2217":{"cid":"5ec4118725de750010919bc4","title":"Main road","feeling":0,"consent":false,"theme":"NA","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":9,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec4118725de750010919bc4","lat":53.7710620172831,"long":-1.57929539680481,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Key destination_,_Need a route here_,_Feels unsafe walking here_,_Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Potential for more cycling here_,_Potential for more walking here_,_Difficult to cross","solutions":"Less traffic_,_Lower speeds_,_Better crossings_,_Wider pavements_,_Space for cycling_,_Trees and planting_,_Places to sit","comment":"NA","abdate":"2020-05-21"},"2218":{"cid":"5ec4120b25de750010919bc5","title":"Bus stop","feeling":0,"consent":false,"theme":"NA","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":5,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec4120b25de750010919bc5","lat":53.7745937406965,"long":-1.56318604946136,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Key destination_,_Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Feels unsafe walking here_,_Difficult to cross_,_Need a route here_,_Potential for more cycling here","solutions":"Less traffic_,_Lower speeds_,_Better crossings_,_Space for cycling_,_Weather protection for queuing_,_Trees and planting_,_Places to sit_,_More space for queuing","comment":"Place a a shelter bus stop with a digital bus time table, make speed limit 2o mph, make better crossing along the whole stretch of road","abdate":"2020-05-21"},"2219":{"cid":"5ec4126f25de750010919bc6","title":"cross flatts ","feeling":0,"consent":false,"theme":"NA","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":4,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec4126f25de750010919bc6","lat":53.7698065036184,"long":-1.55266642570496,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Potential for more walking here_,_Potential for more cycling here_,_Feels unsafe walking here_,_Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Key destination_,_Need a route here","solutions":"Safe clean toilets_,_Trees and planting_,_Places to sit_,_Wider pavements_,_Space for cycling_,_Weather protection for queuing","comment":"add more benches, and make paths wider, add more litter bins ","abdate":"2020-05-21"},"2220":{"cid":"5ec412df25de750010919bc9","title":"Main road","feeling":2,"consent":false,"theme":"NA","subdate":"4 months ago","votes":5,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec412df25de750010919bc9","lat":53.7773707220413,"long":-1.55724763870239,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Key destination_,_Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Potential for more cycling here_,_Difficult to cross","solutions":"Less traffic_,_Lower speeds_,_Wider pavements_,_Better crossings_,_Space for cycling_,_Trees and planting_,_Weather protection for queuing","comment":"add speed cameras ","abdate":"2020-05-21"},"2221":{"cid":"5ec4130f25de750010919bcc","title":"Other","feeling":43,"consent":true,"theme":"Public areas -

I am an \"battle-hardened\" cycle commuter, yet find this unnerving enough, that against my will I now treat the footway as a shared-use path- it's very wide, not busy and has a smooth surface. Indeed, one option to quickly and temporarily fix this problem would be officially designate a shared use path at this point.","abdate":"2020-05-24"},"2795":{"cid":"5ec8f912dff7473f6b6695a9","title":"Thornbury Barracks","feeling":50,"consent":true,"theme":"Main roads - more pedestrian and cycle space","subdate":"3 months ago","votes":5,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ec8f912dff7473f6b6695a9","lat":53.8031346266773,"long":-1.69747352600098,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Key destination","solutions":"Stop Parking on the Superhighway, there is no point in building these cycle lanes if all they become is car parking / unloading lanes.

Restricting the width of roads by installing little used cycling lanes is not only forcing opposing traffic closer together but is also reducing any available space for motorcycles to filter past slow moving traffic to virtually nil, forcing us onto the opposite side of the road to make progress and into the flow of oncoming traffic. Motorcycle parking bays in Leeds have been closed off for bicycles and have remained empty ever since. When are Connecting Leeds going to realise that this is the North of England and not the continent. We do not have the weather to warrant or justify the money being wasted on installing cycle lanes for the amount of days during a typical year, that they will be used. Also there is zero thought given to the role motorcycles could play in reducing congestion in Leeds. When are Connecting Leeds going to grow up and follow the example of cities & towns like Bristol, York, Slough, Birmingham and others and allow Motorcycles to share bus lanes, making it significantly safer than filtering into the face of oncoming traffic. I am not against cycle lanes. I think the network in Holland, which i have visited on numinous occasions, is fantastic. But they have the space and the network works in tandum with the road network an not at the expense of it, which is obviously the policy that Connecting Leeds are blindly following, regardless of the real evidence of under utilisation ","abdate":"2020-05-26"},"2994":{"cid":"5ecc43bb31faeb84d2927399","title":"Moortown corner ","feeling":9,"consent":"NA","theme":"Main roads - more pedestrian and cycle space","subdate":"3 months ago","votes":3,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ecc43bb31faeb84d2927399","lat":53.8442005364447,"long":-1.5336012840271,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Key destination_,_Potential for more cycling here","solutions":"Cycle Parking","comment":"Put some bike racks in and plant some trees.","abdate":"2020-05-26"},"2995":{"cid":"5ecc460f31faeb2e7c9273b4","title":"Main road","feeling":0,"consent":"NA","theme":"Residential streets - safer walking & cycling","subdate":"3 months ago","votes":4,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ecc460f31faeb2e7c9273b4","lat":53.8520933105454,"long":-1.51848842726395,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Feels unsafe walking here_,_Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Not child friendly here","solutions":"Less traffic_,_Lower speeds","comment":"The 40mph speed on this road is unsafe for cyclist and pedestrians, cars regularly exceed the limit.

Very difficult indeed for cyclists from the numerous flats and offices to cross the 3 lanes of traffic, often coming round at speed, e.g to get to A639 towards wakefield. Likewise an issue coming in the opposite direction (southbound) - it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear if the right hand pavement is a joint ped/cycle lane, with a bike sign on the toucan crossing but no marking on the pavement. Often very busy with pedestrians as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear. No road-based route except to follow large detour rather than short 100m from the bridge to manor road. I think having a 2 way cycle lane on the pavement (it is wide enough) would solve this as could use the existing crossing toward the bridge to get to A639 and beyond.

This section of A642 feels particularly unsafe both uphill (steep hill so going slowing often holding up HGVs or being narrow passed by speeding vans) and downhill (often narrow overtaking by impatient cars and vans despite doing 30mph yourself on poor road surface, cars ignoring the no overtaking double white lines). This is a frustration for both motorists and cyclists and a segregated cycle route would avert this. Other pinch point on the commute is the roundabout bridges on a639 over the m1, current route I think suggests going on the path but the surface is rough and still feel very exposed. The work improving the canal towpath is admirable but the steep steps at skelton bridge mean it still isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a viable everyday commuting alternative - I think sorting out the steps into a workable crossing over the canal should be a priority to take bikes away from crossing a major motorway and onto the canal towpath.

On numerous occasions I simply do not expect a car to be turning from the back on my right. Yes it is a gas station but not every single pedestrian has lived in the UK to be fully aware of the mirrored driving system. Since the traffic is coming from the back and I cannot see it, the drivers should be cautious but on many occasions they just drive in without really slowing down. No-one can predict if a pedestrian will suddenly stop. Just an example of incorrect infrastructure. Needs clear markings for both parties to the traffic as a bare minimum.

Ideally we would instruct them to create their own driveway, so we can build a *very* nice fully segregated cycle path. If the road for car was also made more narrow, then this would also reduce voluntary & involuntary speeding. There might also even be space for cycle paths to go behind bus stops!

It's a bit ridiculous & wasteful. There seems to be a significant amount of space to eliminate the central diagonal lines, add a protected cycle lane on one or both sides, while narrowing the road to make it less inviting to intentional/accidental speeding cars - if you make it narrow (but wide enough for buses), cars won't feel confident about going fast. PLEASE NOTE: In winter, Leeds Rd quickly gets very muddy and unpleasant to cycle on, especially with road spray from cars, buses & HGVs. It's VERY unpleasant, especially when vehicles travel with their right wheels on the center line which kicks up more muck. Similarly, in dry weather it's gets terrible because the dusty center line kicks up a huge quantity of dust! Please, try to add a segregated bike lane here. Narrow the car lane if you need to - that'll slow down cars a bit as there is a lot of speeding here also.

That is, cycling in the cycle lane through the chicane of the pedestrian lights results in northbound motorists entering the chicane WITH you, sometimes at a substantially greater speed, and far too close for that speed differential to be safe. These vehicles can be busses or trucks up to 9 feet wide. Then, in addition, it commonly occurs that cars traveling downhill on Churchwood Avenue arrive fast to the junction, often overhanging or being right up against the stop line, so that a cyclist has to move out to clear them safely. This all happens in a short space with vehicles arriving quickly from behind, and already too close. The only safe remedy I've found to this is to take the centre of the main lane prior to arriving at the pedestrian lights, and hold it though the junction. However this is not supported by current road lanes or signage, which therefore needs to change to make the junction safer for cyclists and for potential cyclists who may not initially feel confident to take the lane in this way. For this junction, motorist 'awareness' of cyclists is not enough - there needs to be support for cyclists taking a safe position in the road. Similar width issues arise at the next traffic light controlled junction with Thornbury Avenue, although that seems less serious as there is no near concurrent arrival of side-road vehicles into the cycle lane.","abdate":"2020-06-05"},"3695":{"cid":"5ed8ed7aa528f77d5a78cb49","title":"Main road","feeling":0,"consent":true,"theme":"Main roads - more pedestrian and cycle space","subdate":"3 months ago","votes":3,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ed8ed7aa528f77d5a78cb49","lat":53.8312698612571,"long":-1.5880286693573,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Need a route here_,_Potential for more cycling here_,_Feels unsafe cycling here","solutions":"Lower speeds_,_Improved junction","comment":"The chicane through the traffic lights north bound is too narrow for cyclists and mixed vehicles and a 30mph limit.","abdate":"2020-06-05"},"3696":{"cid":"5ed8f3363d6c59173dccf906","title":"Other","feeling":14,"consent":"NA","theme":"Public areas - more pedestrian space","subdate":"3 months ago","votes":6,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ed8f3363d6c59173dccf906","lat":53.875986366102,"long":-1.54327869415283,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Need a route here_,_Feels unsafe walking here_,_Potential for more cycling here_,_Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Not child friendly here","solutions":"Lower speeds_,_Less traffic_,_Space for cycling","comment":"A loop round Eccup is a key route for local exercise in a beautiful area for both walkers and cyclists.

The footway should be kept clear of mounted parked cars in order to create a safe and secure walking environment. Bentcliffe Gardens is a street with ample off road parking with generous driveways and garages to park private cars. If vehicles are parked on the carriageway and not the pavement on this street we will instantly create a more attractive environment. Cars properly parked on the carriageway will also help slow the speed of traffic, making the environment much safer for walking.  This street should be considered as a pilot for a ban on pavement parking as part of the package of measures to create a School Zone to promote social distancing and help improve air quality and encourage walking and cycling.

People cycling who need to wait in the current very narrow 'box' will need to restart off uphill, and therefore likely a bit wobbly. Meanwhile they will likely experience cars passing close from behind, accelerating up the hill to keep their speed up, while oncoming cars arriving downhill have longer stopping distances especially in the wet and often drive over or stop in what should be the protected cycle right hand box. I have seen one casualty here, and many people who feel so unsupported by the road markings that they get off lower down the hill, cross at the traffic lights and walk up the hill. This street needs fewer vehicles, lower speeds and adequate traffic management signage.

Many children walk to and from Pudsey schools up this road, and it is also key pedestrian access to the split-level train station and supermarket. Traffic queues uphill, and when the lights go red, cars from Hough Lane routinely shoot the lights to speed down Swinnow Road. There is no pavement on one side of the road, forcing passengers, shoppers, children and residents to cross the road twice if they want to get to Elder Road. Most people do not walk all the way to the top, where the lights are, and back down again. The road engineering here is shocking - it sends pedestrians in between queuing cars, with cars jumping the red lights just above. The road is also dreadful for cyclists trying to turn right into Elder Road, or cycling down Swinnow Road at all. Children who might otherwise cycle to the many schools in Pudsey would not be safe, or feel safe, cycling on Swinnow Road.

In doing so, they are making the estate extremely busy and dangerous at key times when children on the estate are going to/coming home from school. The estate is also been used as a parking facility for parents taking children to school who do not live on the estate but close to it & within walking distance.  This is a family estate with 5 schools in very close proximity. In addition to this, although it is a 20mph zone, cars often speed through the estate with no consideration that pedestrians could be crossing roads nor vehicles coming to other way through the mentioned junctions.  The solution would be to block off one of the 2 named junctions listed above.  This would prevent vehicles from using the estate as a cut through, prevent parking on the estate and therefore encourage walking/cycling to & from the schools.  It would also solve the problem of cars speeding through the estate and using it as a race track.  This solution was explored a number of years ago and rejected at the time.  Since then, things have got much worse with vehicles cutting through, parking and speeding on the estate.  I strongly recommend that this solution is revisited as soon as possible.","abdate":"2020-06-29"},"4106":{"cid":"5ede587c01ba6431e5b370bb","title":"Residential street","feeling":49,"consent":false,"theme":"Residential streets - safer walking & cycling","subdate":"3 months ago","votes":0,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ede587c01ba6431e5b370bb","lat":53.7920704453662,"long":-1.61073088645935,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Feels unsafe walking here_,_Feels unsafe cycling here_,_Not child friendly here","solutions":"Lower speeds","comment":"Silver Royd hill in Wortley needs some traffic calming measures like chicanes.

This prevents some dangerous\u00c2\u00a0overtaking, but then I've experienced drivers delayed\u00c2\u00a0 (by may be a whole 60s in their pressing engagements) behave very aggressively when they finally pass me, having been prevented by a driver ahead of them not overtaking-- excessive revving, hurled abuse, passing too close, that kind of encouraging thing!!!\u00c2\u00a0 As it stands King lane is not fit for the purpose for which it is used, i.e. commuting into and out of Leeds.\u00c2\u00a0 It's too narrow, and too twisty.\u00c2\u00a0 Why did LCC ever put a park and ride on it near the ring road and sign\u00c2\u00a0even more commuter traffic this way???\u00c2\u00a0 (Was it back in the 1960-70s?). Suggestions to prevent future/further serious injury\u00c2\u00a0or death to cyclists or pedestrians:1) As others have suggested, since any vehicle driver has the option of using the ring road (not currently safe for cyclist either because there's no provision on the 70mph dual-carriageway section), it could just be closed to motorised vehicles from the junction with Arthington road to Alwoodley lane (plus closing Stair foot lane, lest that becomes an even worse rat run route).\u00c2\u00a0 It'd make a lovely route, where there's space to have really separated cycle and pedestrian paths.\u00c2\u00a0 Of course, the denizens of Alwoodley will scream blue murder...2) Make it a one-way route (same section) for vehicular traffic, perhaps with a tidal direction flow control (morning rush hour into Leeds, evening out).\u00c2\u00a0 If passing places were inserted, with a little road widening it could even be two-way at other times, vehicle drivers could then decide whether it's worth the effort!\u00c2\u00a0 With a single vehicle lane, the other could become\u00c2\u00a0 the cycle/pedestrian\u00c2\u00a0route.3) Introduce a one way system as follows: from the junction of The Avenue and King lane, outbound traffic would take The Avenue and\u00c2\u00a0 Alwoodley lane (both kept 2 way), then turn right onto a one-way King lane, as far as the Arthington road junction; inbound traffic would continue along Arthington road, then right on Eccup lane/Church lane, left on Back Church lane, and left again up Stair foot lane, and finally right down King lane to the Avenue junction. For safety reasons, all this section would probably also have to be made one-way, though the first section (Arthington, Eccup, Church might be okay as two-way).4) Significantly widen the entire route from the A660 to the Avenue junction in order to fit cycle lanes both ways and a proper footway.","abdate":"2020-07-03"},"4190":{"cid":"5ee379e2ca7f14825bc0d839","title":"Other","feeling":25,"consent":true,"theme":"Residential streets - safer walking & cycling","subdate":"3 months ago","votes":1,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5ee379e2ca7f14825bc0d839","lat":53.8156527680611,"long":-1.4447021484375,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"NA","solutions":"Stop cars from parking on pavements ","comment":"This is a general statement not specific tom my area.

And drivers being drivers, half of them seem oblivious to this potential (having once been very close to a head-on collision with a car, I did at least get the Highways Dept. to repaint the on road cycle markings, on the second time of request via my local councillor) .  However, it still feels unsafe, both when in the contraflow and when turning right into it from Lovell Park road, since drivers turning right from Elmwood ln onto LP road, rarely look for cyclists turning across them. 2 suggestions: ideally please close Elmwood ln to motorised traffic (excepting the access at the Clay Pit lane end to the Lloyds building of course). Drivers can easily continue on Clay Pit lane and use Merrion Way; or at the very least make Elmwood lane to LP road left turn only- there's really littel penalty for vehicles having to use Merrion way instead for that routing.","abdate":"2020-07-10"},"4267":{"cid":"5eec8beeea71036f1325536c","title":"Main road","feeling":11,"consent":true,"theme":"Main roads - more pedestrian and cycle space","subdate":"3 months ago","votes":1,"url":"https://leedscovidsuggestascheme.commonplace.is/comments/5eec8beeea71036f1325536c","lat":53.7675617037877,"long":-1.50239109992981,"wantperm":"NA","issues":"Need a route here_,_Potential for more cycling here_,_Feels unsafe walking here","solutions":"Wider pavements_,_Space for cycling_,_The rail overbridge is to be re-designed as part of HS2.

There is no provision for pedestrians to pass safely (pre Covid!) and it doesn't meet the requirement for social distancing. Cyclists are forced to one side as vehicles attempt to overtake. Near the Village Hall, Old Lane, the road is single lane only, with narrow pavements. Vehicle wing mirrors overhang the narrow pavements and risk injury to everyone, including children and old people. This is a very popular route for exercise, continuing via Occupation Lane where crossing for pedestrians is very poor. The route returns to the village via Moor Road.
